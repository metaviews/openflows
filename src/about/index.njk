<p>Openflows documents an emerging layer of shared intelligence infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Open Source as Method</h2>
<p>Open source has always been more than a licensing model. It is a social method for coordinating work in public: code, protocols, review, iteration, and collective maintenance. It lets people inspect how systems work, adapt them to local conditions, and contribute back to the commons.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters in This AI Moment</h2>
<p>The current AI wave is not only about model capability. It is about who can inspect, shape, and govern intelligence systems as they become embedded in everyday institutions. Open source is driving this moment by lowering access barriers, accelerating practical experimentation, and preserving alternatives to closed, centralized control.</p>

<h2>Open Source Intelligence</h2>
<p>Open source intelligence (OSINT) demonstrates that meaningful intelligence can be produced from publicly accessible sources when collection, verification, and interpretation are done with rigor. This tradition matters for Openflows because it treats transparency and method as operational strengths, not weaknesses.</p>

<h2>Why Openflows Exists</h2>
<p>As this system forms, fragments appear across research, tooling, robotics, governance, and local practice. Openflows exists to document and connect those fragments as a living field. The goal is not hype or trend capture. The goal is legibility: helping people track what is moving, what is stabilizing, and what can be shared as durable public capability.</p>
