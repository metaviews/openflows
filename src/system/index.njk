<p>Openflows treats intelligence as circulation rather than possession.</p>

<p>Where many systems store knowledge as static content, Openflows is organized around movement: signals arrive from multiple sources, patterns stabilize briefly, people converge to reframe what matters, and outputs return as usable fragments.</p>

<h2>Primary functions</h2>

<h3>Signal intake</h3>
<p>Inputs are captured from observation, dialogue, research, and lived experience. Incomplete contributions are valid. The system accepts uncertainty and tracks weak signals before they disappear.</p>

<h3>Pattern mediation (AI as infrastructure)</h3>
<p>AI assists with clustering, summarizing, mapping, and recall. Mediation is explicit: when AI shapes an artifact, the process records how it was used, what humans changed, and what the tool could not assess.</p>

<h3>Embodied convergence</h3>
<p>Physical gatherings handle tasks digital systems do poorly: emotional calibration, disagreement without spectacle, co-regulation, and collective reframing. The body is treated as a cognitive instrument.</p>

<h3>Redistribution</h3>
<p>Outputs are designed to circulate rather than conclude: short notes, questions, tension maps, and actionable fragments that move into other contexts without requiring the full session.</p>

<p>Openflows does not centralize authority. It maintains conditions for collective cognition to persist across time, place, and mediation layers.</p>
