### Signal

Moxie Marlinspike is a security engineer and builder associated with end-to-end encrypted communication systems deployed at global scale.

### Context

The core contribution is operational: moving advanced cryptographic guarantees from specialist domains into mainstream, usable products. This shifts privacy from an expert practice to a practical default for ordinary communication.

### Relevance

For Openflows, Marlinspike is an operator reference for building trustworthy systems under adversarial conditions, where protocol design and product usability must cohere.

### Current State

Durable influence on privacy-preserving communication and security-aware software practice.

### Open Questions

- How should secure protocol ecosystems balance openness with responsible stewardship?
- What tradeoffs emerge when privacy-by-default systems meet platform-level policy pressure?
- Which patterns from secure messaging transfer cleanly to AI-mediated communication tools?
