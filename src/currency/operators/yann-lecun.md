### Signal

Yann LeCun is a foundational AI researcher whose recent emphasis on world models and predictive representation shapes major technical direction in the field.

### Context

Rather than centering only next-token generation, this line of work prioritizes learning compact, structured representations that support planning, reasoning, and action under uncertainty.

### Relevance

For Openflows, LeCun is an operator-level signal for a shift from pure language prediction toward grounded intelligence architectures with stronger transfer to physical and multimodal systems.

### Current State

Active high-leverage research and institutional influence on future model architecture agendas.

### Open Questions

- Which world-model benchmarks best capture real transfer into embodied tasks?
- How can representation-first methods remain auditable as scale increases?
- Where do these approaches most clearly outperform token-prediction baselines in practice?

### Connections

- Linked to `vjepa-meta` and `rynnbrain` as direct signals of predictive and embodied intelligence trajectories.
