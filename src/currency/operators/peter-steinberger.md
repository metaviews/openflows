### Signal

Peter Steinberger is a software engineer and builder known for creating developer infrastructure in public, from PSPDFKit to recent open agent and AI-native tooling work.

### Context

The pattern that matters is not only entrepreneurship. It is public implementation as method: shipping tools quickly, exposing working parts, and treating developer workflows as sites for direct experimentation rather than sealed products.

### Relevance

For Openflows, Steinberger represents an operator at the transition from traditional developer tooling to inspectable agent operations. His work helps make AI-mediated software practice legible at the level of runtime, orchestration, and day-to-day engineering use.

### Current State

Active operator signal in open agent tooling, AI-native development workflows, and fast public iteration on developer infrastructure.

### Open Questions

- Which parts of AI-native development practice will remain durable after the current tooling cycle stabilizes?
- How should open agent frameworks balance rapid experimentation with security and governance discipline?
- What makes developer-facing AI systems genuinely inspectable rather than merely customizable?

### Connections

- Linked to `openclaw` and `inspectable-agent-operations` as the clearest current and circuit adjacencies.
