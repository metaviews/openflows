### Signal

Eliot Horowitz is a systems builder focused on making robotics programmable and maintainable through coherent software infrastructure.

### Context

The operating thesis is that robotics progress depends on integrating deployment tooling, data pipelines, model workflows, and fleet observability into one practical layer.

### Relevance

For Openflows, Horowitz represents a high-leverage operator pattern: reduce fragmentation between research prototypes and production physical systems.

### Current State

Active infrastructure signal at the software-robotics boundary.

### Open Questions

- Which abstractions in robotics platforms become durable standards versus temporary scaffolding?
- How can operator tooling preserve local control while enabling centralized fleet learning?
- What governance patterns are needed when physical autonomy systems are remotely managed at scale?

### Connections

- Linked to `viam` and `openpilot` as adjacent infrastructure and autonomy execution pathways.
