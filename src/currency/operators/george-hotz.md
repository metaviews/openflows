### Signal

George Hotz is an autonomy-focused operator known for shipping open, real-world systems that expose the full engineering loop from code to hardware behavior.

### Context

This operating style privileges field feedback over abstract benchmarks and treats deployment constraints as first-class design inputs.

### Relevance

For Openflows, Hotz is a reference for legible autonomy practice under adversarial reality: latency, safety boundaries, sensor limitations, and continual iteration.

### Current State

Durable influence on open autonomy culture and practical end-to-end engineering discipline.

### Open Questions

- How should open autonomy projects formalize safety assurance without stalling iteration?
- Which interfaces best support external auditing of real-world control behavior?
- What parts of this approach transfer cleanly from driving stacks to general robotics?

### Connections

- Linked to `openpilot` and `your-own-robot` as concrete autonomy and embodied build signals.
