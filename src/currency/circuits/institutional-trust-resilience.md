This circuit starts from a specific finding.

The Media Ecosystem Observatory brief, [Conspiratorial Claims and Institutional Distrust in Canada's Online Ecosystem](https://meo.ca/work/conspiratorial-claims-and-institutional-distrust-in-canadas-online-ecosystem), identifies a tight amplification structure rather than a diffuse public phenomenon. Using a nationally representative survey and a dataset of 14 million posts across X, TikTok, Instagram, and Bluesky, the research finds that awareness of anti-institutional conspiratorial claims is widespread, but belief remains limited. Attention, however, is highly concentrated: influencers produce most of the claims, X carries the heaviest engagement load, and a small set of accounts drive most of the visible circulation.

That changes the operational problem.

The issue is not simply false belief at mass scale. The issue is repeated attention capture around institutional distrust, especially at moments of public tension, where suspicion is packaged as explanation and then rewarded by platform dynamics.

Response therefore has to work as a loop.

First, identify concentration: which claims are rising, which accounts are repeatedly seeding them, and which events trigger amplification. Second, strengthen trusted channels: public-interest communication has to move through spaces where evidence, context, and accountability can persist longer than outrage spikes. Third, convert critique into process: distrust cannot be answered by reassurance alone, but by visible procedures for correction, explanation, and institutional accountability.

This is where the circuit closes.

Observation feeds intervention.
Intervention is measured for actual change in exposure and trust conditions.
Weak responses are revised.
Trusted communicators, community operators, and institutions adapt their methods together.

What stabilizes is not agreement.

What stabilizes is a civic capacity to distinguish legitimate institutional criticism from conspiratorial framing that treats hidden coordination as the default explanation for public life.

Within Openflows, this circuit extends the feedback pattern into information ecosystem resilience.
It also raises the standard for civic AI systems: tools operating in public-interest contexts need to support contextualization, verification, and trust repair rather than merely accelerating engagement.

The loop is complete when critique remains possible, evidence remains legible, and distrust no longer compounds automatically through platform incentives.
