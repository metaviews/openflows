[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.im/) is an open source agent framework oriented toward local execution and user configuration. It invites the user into the mechanics of automation: installing dependencies, configuring environments, understanding how tasks are composed.

Running it is participatory. The system is visible. The components are legible. You can see how the agent is assembled and where decisions occur. That visibility changes the experience of using AI. It becomes architectural rather than purely conversational.

OpenClaw emphasizes process. Agents are compositions of instructions, tools, and execution loops. You can trace them. You can adjust them. You can fork them.

For Openflows, this aligns with the idea that literacy is infrastructural. Tools that expose structure cultivate awareness. Even friction becomes instructive. It trains attention toward underlying layers.

OpenClaw feels like a workshop space. Not yet integrated, but clearly resonant.

Still circulating.
