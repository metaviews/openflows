### Signal

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.im/) is an open source agent framework oriented toward local execution and explicit user configuration.

### Context

Its workflow foregrounds assembly: dependencies, instructions, tool wiring, and execution loops remain visible and adjustable.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this reinforces the literacy-through-practice requirement. Inspectable systems develop operational awareness in ways opaque assistants cannot.

### Current State

Resonant framework pattern; not yet integrated into local stack.

### Open Questions

- Which OpenClaw patterns transfer cleanly into Openflows operations?
- How much setup friction is productive versus exclusionary?
- What guardrails are needed to keep inspectability without cognitive overload?

### Connections

- Linked to `peter-steinberger` as the operator most directly associated with this current.
