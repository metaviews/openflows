### Signal

[OutcryAI](https://www.outcryai.com/) is a specialized AI assistant for activism and social organizing, positioned as strategy support rather than general-purpose chat.

### Context

The public research report dated **July 27, 2025** describes an evolution from prompt-engineered systems to custom model work via DAPT and LoRA, with explicit attention to activist constraints (cost, privacy, control, and movement-relevant knowledge).

### Relevance

For Openflows, OutcryAI is a clear civic-intelligence signal: AI configured for collective action contexts, where historical memory, tactical reasoning, and value alignment matter as much as model capability.

### Current State

Active activist-AI experiment with published technical reflection and a stated trajectory from API dependence toward more autonomous model infrastructure.

### Open Questions

- How can activist AI systems preserve strategic depth without centralizing movement epistemology into a single voice?
- What governance and safety boundaries are needed when tactical advice interfaces with real-world protest conditions?
- Which parts of activist-domain model development should be open for external audit versus operationally private?

### Connections

- Linked to `audrey-tang`, `moxie-marlinspike`, and `confer-to` for civic practice, privacy architecture, and conversational-structure adjacency.
