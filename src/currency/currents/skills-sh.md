### Signal

[skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) presents a skills-oriented approach to structuring agent capabilities as reusable operational units.

### Context

Skill modularity reduces prompt sprawl and turns tacit operator routines into explicit, versionable artifacts.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this supports method legibility: capability is easier to inspect, compare, and evolve when encoded as discrete skills.

### Current State

Strong conceptual fit with workflow standardization and collaborative AI operations.

### Open Questions

- Which skill packaging conventions are durable across tools and runtimes?
- How should teams validate skill quality before broad reuse?
- What governance model best prevents drift in shared skill libraries?

### Connections
