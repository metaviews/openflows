### Signal

[6pack.care](https://6pack.care/) presents a one-minute AI-supported check-in and scoring flow ("6pack Score") designed to help users optimize daily health behaviors.

### Context

The public landing page describes a method centered on six everyday domains: sleep quality, mood/emotional state, energy level, muscle readiness/recovery, cognitive sharpness/focus, and stress/pressure management.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is a useful signal of embodied, personal-scale intelligence infrastructure: small repeated feedback loops, low interaction overhead, and behavior-oriented guidance rather than one-time outputs.

### Current State

Live product signal with clear focus on daily self-regulation through lightweight AI mediation.

### Open Questions

- How transparent is the scoring logic and recommendation method to users over time?
- What evidence standards are used to validate behavior-change claims and outcomes?
- How can personalization remain useful without becoming opaque or over-prescriptive?

### Connections

- Linked to `openpilot` as another loop-oriented system where ongoing feedback, constraints, and iteration shape outcomes.
