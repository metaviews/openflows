### Signal

[Open Assistant](https://projects.laion.ai/Open-Assistant/) demonstrated a community-built, open conversational assistant with transparent training and reproducible components.

### Context

Its most active implementation phase has slowed, but the project remains a reference model for participatory AI development outside closed product pipelines.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is methodologically relevant: capability, governance, and transparency can be designed together rather than treated as separate concerns.

### Current State

Lower operational activity, high reference value.

### Open Questions

- Which governance patterns from this model can be reused locally?
- What is required to sustain open assistant projects beyond launch cycles?
- How can participatory data practices remain practical at smaller scales?

### Connections
