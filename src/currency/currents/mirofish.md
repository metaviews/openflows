### Signal

[MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish) proposes a memory-oriented operating layer for AI-era work, centered on persistent context across sessions.

### Context

The emphasis shifts from one-off model responses toward continuity: what can be captured, organized, and re-entered in future cycles.

### Relevance

For Openflows, continuity is a structural condition for compounding cognition. A memory OS pattern suggests local intelligence that can be iterated, inspected, and revised over time.

### Current State

Emergent infrastructure pattern with active exploration.

### Open Questions

- How should personal knowledge boundaries be encoded and audited?
- What primitives are needed for portable, local-first memory continuity?
- How can memory systems avoid silent accumulation of low-quality context?

### Connections

- Linked to `local-inference-baseline` as a dependency condition.
- Linked to `bettafish` as a parallel memory-layer exploration.
