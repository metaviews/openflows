### Signal

[Kimi.com](https://www.kimi.com/) now foregrounds K2.5 modes, including Agent Swarm (beta), with visual coding and multi-tool workflows as default interaction patterns.

### Context

The Kimi research release frames K2.5 as a multimodal model with parallel sub-agent orchestration and broad deployment across web, app, API, and coding tooling.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is movement toward interface-level normalization of orchestration. Multi-agent coordination is becoming an ordinary end-user surface rather than a specialist backend pattern.

### Current State

Rapidly evolving public product plus research narrative.

### Open Questions

- Which orchestration controls remain user-visible versus hidden in managed defaults?
- How stable are quality and latency when parallelism is pushed on long tasks?
- What governance practices are needed when swarm behavior becomes commonplace?

### Connections
