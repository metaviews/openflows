### Signal

Boundary Pulse records moments when constraints tighten or relax and where new flow becomes possible.

### Context

Constraints shift across technical, procedural, and social layers. Small changes in access, policy, or tooling can alter movement patterns quickly.

### Relevance

For Openflows, boundary changes mark where circulation can accelerate or stall. Tracking these moments supports timely adjustment before bottlenecks become structural.

### Current State

Active monitoring frame used for situational awareness.

### Open Questions

- Which boundary shifts have the highest downstream impact?
- How quickly should response pathways adapt when constraints change?
- What signals distinguish temporary friction from durable limits?

### Connections
