### Signal

[OpenFang](https://www.openfang.sh/) presents itself as an open-source agent operating system built in Rust, combining autonomous agents, channel adapters, built-in tools, and sandboxed execution into a single runtime.

### Context

The movement here is from lightweight agent frameworks toward full-stack operational environments. Orchestration, memory, security controls, channel integration, and desktop/runtime management are bundled into one opinionated system.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this matters because it makes mediation infrastructure explicit at the systems level. A security-aware agent runtime is easier to audit, constrain, and reason about than loosely assembled automation chains.

### Current State

Emerging but ambitious infrastructure signal, with a strong emphasis on sandboxing, auditability, and autonomous workflow packaging.

### Open Questions

- Which security claims hold up under independent review in real deployments?
- How much operational complexity is reduced versus merely relocated into the runtime?
- What governance patterns are needed when autonomous agents span many communication channels?

### Connections

- Linked to `crewai` and `overture-sixhq` as orchestration adjacencies.
- Linked to `signal-org` as a communication-trust boundary adjacency.
