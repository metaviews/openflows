### Signal

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) has become a practical local runtime pattern for pulling, running, and serving models from developer machines.

### Context

Its operational simplicity lowers the threshold for local AI experimentation and reduces dependence on opaque hosted defaults.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this advances agency through inspectable local execution pathways and faster iteration under direct operator control.

### Current State

Widely recognized baseline tool in local-model workflows.

### Open Questions

- Which deployment practices best balance convenience with reproducibility?
- How should model provenance and version control be tracked in local-first teams?
- What monitoring patterns are needed when local runtimes move into shared environments?

### Connections
