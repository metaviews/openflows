### Signal

Signal Drift tracks subtle changes in attention and movement before they become stable patterns.

### Context

The pattern is assembled from repeated observations across sessions rather than single events. It is most visible in small directional shifts over short intervals.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this supports early interpretation before movement hardens into assumptions. It helps preserve sensitivity to weak but consequential changes.

### Current State

Active interpretive method with recurring use.

### Open Questions

- Which drift indicators are reliable across contexts?
- When should drift trigger intervention versus continued observation?
- How can tone and edge cases remain visible in summary workflows?

### Connections
