### Signal

[BettaFish](https://github.com/666ghj/BettaFish/blob/main/README-EN.md) presents an open source memory plugin architecture for AI tools and local model workflows.

### Context

Its structure emphasizes adapters and data connectors, treating memory as a composable layer instead of a fixed built-in feature.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this sharpens a key transition: once local inference is available, memory governance becomes the next agency layer. Retrieval scope and retention control become design decisions.

### Current State

Early but technically directional.

### Open Questions

- Which memory interfaces are transparent enough for non-expert operators?
- How should retention and deletion be governed across local contexts?
- What tradeoff between convenience and inspectability is acceptable?

### Connections

- Linked to `local-inference-baseline` as an extension path.
