### Signal

[Viam](https://www.viam.com/) presents itself as a full-stack software platform for robotics and AI, centered on hardware integration, data/ML workflows, and fleet management.

### Context

The platform emphasizes one workflow from prototype to production, with SDK-based control across languages and a modular registry model for hardware and software resources. Public positioning highlights "200+ components" and "1,000 modules" as a compatibility and extensibility signal. A concrete business milestone was announced on March 3, 2025: Viam's $30M Series C fundraise.

### Relevance

For Openflows, Viam represents infrastructural convergence: robotics control, telemetry, and model operations are treated as one continuous software surface instead of separate stacks.

### Current State

Active commercial platform with growing enterprise deployment posture.

### Open Questions

- How open does the stack remain as enterprise features and managed workflows deepen?
- Which parts of operational control are durable across cloud-connected and edge-constrained deployments?
- What is the lock-in profile around registry modules, APIs, and fleet tooling over multi-year horizons?

### Connections

- Linked to `local-inference-baseline` as a physical-systems extension of local intelligence infrastructure.
