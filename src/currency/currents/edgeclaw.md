### Signal

[EdgeClaw](https://github.com/openbmb/edgeclaw) is a public repository signal in the edge AI and robotics-adjacent development space.

### Context

Open edge projects matter because they move intelligence workflows closer to local hardware constraints and real-world operational conditions.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this aligns with inspectable autonomy at the edge, where configuration and execution decisions remain visible to practitioners.

### Current State

Early movement signal with practical relevance to local inference and embodied systems.

### Open Questions

- Which parts of the stack are currently most reusable for small local deployments?
- How does the project handle deployment constraints across heterogeneous hardware?
- What safety and observability patterns are emerging at runtime?

### Connections
