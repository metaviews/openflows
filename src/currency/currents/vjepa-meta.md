### Signal

[Meta's V-JEPA research page](https://ai.meta.com/research/vjepa/) points to a video-based Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture line that emphasizes prediction in representation space rather than raw-pixel reconstruction.

### Context

Meta's related public materials present V-JEPA as a world-model direction for physical reasoning, with V-JEPA 2 extending toward planning-oriented behavior from large-scale video learning.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is movement in embodied cognition infrastructure. If predictive world models become more reliable, AI can support action coordination in physical contexts with less brittle task-specific training.

### Current State

Research-forward and strategically influential; practical deployment patterns are still consolidating.

### Open Questions

- How transferable are learned representations across environments with distribution shift?
- Which safety checks are required before planning signals are coupled to physical action?
- What forms of interpretability are feasible for JEPA-style internal representations?
