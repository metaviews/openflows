### Signal

[CodeWiki](https://codewiki.google/) is presented as a public-preview service that auto-generates repository wikis from code, updates those wikis with each commit, and supports chat plus visual diagrams over the codebase.

### Context

The model is not just question-answering over code. It is persistent synthesis that rewrites shared project memory as the code changes.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is a direct shift in collective cognition infrastructure. Team memory is increasingly mediated by generated artifacts rather than only human-written docs.

### Current State

Preview-stage and capability-forward; operational trust patterns are still forming.

### Open Questions

- How should teams validate generated wiki updates before treating them as canonical?
- Which repository sizes and architectures degrade synthesis quality?
- What review protocol keeps generated summaries from replacing source-level reading discipline?

### Connections

No explicit currency link added yet.
