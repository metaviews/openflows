[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) is a desktop application that makes it straightforward to download and run language models locally. It provides a graphical interface for managing models, adjusting parameters, and interacting with them directly on personal hardware.

Local inference becomes tangible. Instead of configuring environments manually, users can experiment with models through a cohesive interface. It lowers the activation energy required to host intelligence on one's own machine.

The experience shifts AI from remote service to local capability. Models become files you manage, not endpoints you call. Intelligence becomes something that sits on your desk, bound to your processor and memory.

For Openflows, LM Studio highlights the power of normalization. When local inference becomes ordinary, agency becomes plausible. Infrastructure quietly relocates.
