### Signal

[AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) packages retrieval, workspace management, and conversational interfaces into an open-source deployment option.

### Context

It turns model access plus document context into repeatable team workflows, reducing the gap between raw model endpoints and usable local knowledge interfaces.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this improves practical accessibility while preserving inspectability: teams can run knowledge workflows with clear control over runtime and data pathways.

### Current State

Widely visible open-source pattern for self-hosted AI workspace operations.

### Open Questions

- Which data-segmentation defaults are needed for safe multi-tenant use?
- How should retrieval quality be evaluated across heterogeneous document sets?
- What governance practices keep local convenience aligned with long-term security?

### Connections

- Linked to `local-inference-baseline` and `ollama` as infrastructural adjacencies.
