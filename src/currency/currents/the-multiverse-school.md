### Signal

[The Multiverse School](https://themultiverse.school/) positions itself as an AI-native learning environment with curriculum and participation models shaped by rapid tooling change.

### Context

As intelligence systems become ordinary instruments, learning environments are shifting from static delivery toward practice-based fluency, collaboration, and iteration.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this supports a core premise: literacy must be operational. Agency depends on people being able to inspect systems, test assumptions, and coordinate human-machine work.

### Current State

Active social and pedagogical signal.

### Open Questions

- Which teaching formats produce durable AI literacy rather than surface familiarity?
- How can AI-native education stay inclusive while tools change quickly?
- What balance of technical depth and civic framing is most transferable?
