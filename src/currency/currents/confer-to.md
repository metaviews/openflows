[Confer.to](https://confer.to/) is an experiment in anonymous AI conversation. It presents a simple interface for interacting with language models without requiring account creation or persistent identity. The emphasis is on immediacy: arrive, speak, leave.

Without profiles or stored history, each exchange stands on its own. Conversation becomes episodic rather than cumulative. The system feels closer to a public square than a private assistant.

Anonymity here operates as a structural condition. It reshapes the relationship between speaker and system. It encourages exploratory thought. It lowers the threshold for provisional language. It makes interaction feel lighter.

For Openflows, confer.to surfaces a quiet principle: intelligence can circulate without attachment. Not every interaction needs to accumulate memory. Not every exchange needs to bind identity to cognition.

This one remains open. Observed. In motion.
