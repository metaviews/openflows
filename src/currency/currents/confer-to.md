### Signal

[Confer.to](https://confer.to/) is an anonymous AI conversation interface built around immediacy: arrive, interact, and leave without account persistence.

### Context

Without profiles or stored histories, each exchange is episodic. The interaction model behaves more like a public interaction surface than a private assistant.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this surfaces a useful condition: intelligence can circulate without identity attachment. Not every exchange requires cumulative memory.

### Current State

Active experiment with clear structural distinctiveness.

### Open Questions

- What forms of trust are possible without persistent identity?
- Where are the limits of anonymous interaction for sustained work?
- How should abuse prevention be handled without over-centralizing control?

### Connections
