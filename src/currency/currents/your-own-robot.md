### Signal

[Your Own Robot](https://www.yourownrobot.ai/) positions a build-your-own, bimanual mobile manipulator pathway, with external references describing a sub-$10k hardware target and open components.

### Context

The visible project pattern is a practical robotics stack intended for replication by smaller teams rather than only large labs. Cost ceiling and documentation are treated as core design variables.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this points to embodied agency infrastructure. Physical AI capability matters more when it is inspectable, reproducible, and not restricted to high-capital actors.

### Current State

Emerging and documentation-led; real-world durability remains to be validated across contexts.

### Open Questions

- Which subsystems are most fragile when replicated outside the reference environment?
- How much calibration skill is required for non-specialist teams?
- What shared maintenance norms are needed for distributed hardware commons?

### Connections
