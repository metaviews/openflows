### Signal

[Cleo](https://github.com/kryptobaseddev/cleo) appears as an open-source AI tooling project published in a public repository.

### Context

Public repos are operational classrooms: implementation choices, interfaces, and tradeoffs remain visible for adaptation rather than hidden behind product abstraction.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is a literacy current. Open implementation surfaces help users build direct understanding of how AI workflows are assembled and where control points actually exist.

### Current State

Early open-project current; useful as a traceable practice artifact.

### Open Questions

- Which parts of the project architecture are stable enough to reuse across environments?
- What governance and maintenance patterns would make the project durable beyond early iteration?
- How can this workflow remain inspectable as features and dependencies grow?

### Connections
