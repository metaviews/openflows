### Signal

[Signal.org](https://signal.org/) anchors a privacy-first communication stack with end-to-end encryption as a default rather than an optional mode.

### Context

As AI systems are increasingly embedded into communication workflows, secure messaging infrastructure becomes a structural dependency for trust, safety, and autonomy in both personal and collective coordination.

### Relevance

For Openflows, Signal is a foundational communications current: without reliable private channels, civic intelligence practice and movement coordination become vulnerable to surveillance, manipulation, and chilling effects.

### Current State

Durable infrastructure current in secure digital communication with ongoing relevance to AI-era governance and civic resilience.

### Open Questions

- How can private messaging infrastructures preserve strong security defaults while integrating selective AI assistance?
- What boundary should exist between local/on-device intelligence and remote model mediation in secure communication tools?
- Which governance mechanisms best maintain long-term trust in mission-critical communication infrastructure?

### Connections

- Linked to `meredith-whittaker` and `moxie-marlinspike` as operator anchors for governance and protocol architecture.
