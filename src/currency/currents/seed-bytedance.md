### Signal

[ByteDance Seed](https://seed.bytedance.com/) presents itself as a general intelligence research team (est. 2023) and is publishing frequent model releases across agentic, video, and multimodal domains.

### Context

Recent Seed announcements indicate rapid iteration in practical deployment surfaces, including the official release of Seed1.8 (generalized agentic model, 2025-12-18) and Seedance 2.0 (next-generation video model, 2026-02-12).

### Relevance

For Openflows, this is a signal of acceleration: model labs are no longer separated cleanly by modality. Agent behavior, vision, video, and interface interaction are converging into integrated operational stacks that can quickly enter mainstream products.

### Current State

High-velocity release cycle with expanding multimodal scope.

### Open Questions

- Which capabilities remain most inspectable to external researchers and developers?
- How durable are reported gains across independent evaluations and longer time horizons?
- What governance patterns are needed when agentic and generative video systems converge at scale?
