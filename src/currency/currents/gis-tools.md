### Signal

[GIS Tools](https://gis.tools/) aggregates geospatial software and related resources into a single discovery surface.

### Context

Accessible tool indexes reduce setup friction for mapping and spatial analysis work, especially where teams need to compare options quickly and move from discovery to implementation.

### Relevance

For Openflows, geospatial tooling supports place-aware intelligence: local sensing, regional coordination, and infrastructure planning all depend on reliable spatial workflows.

### Current State

Useful indexing signal for open and practical geospatial operations.

### Open Questions

- Which listed tools are most viable for local-first, inspectable deployments?
- How should quality and maintenance status be evaluated across a broad directory?
- What minimal stack best supports Openflows mapping needs without excess complexity?

### Connections
