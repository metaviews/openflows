### Signal

[Arcee AI](https://www.arcee.ai/) represents a strong small-model current: emphasis on deployable language systems that can be tuned for real infrastructure constraints.

### Context

The practical movement is away from one-size-fits-all frontier dependency and toward model choice based on latency, cost, hardware profile, and operational control.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this supports agency-through-architecture. Smaller, inspectable, deployable model pathways make it easier to align AI behavior with local institutional needs.

### Current State

Active deployment-oriented current in the efficient-model layer.

### Open Questions

- Which evaluation practices best compare small-model stacks against larger hosted alternatives for real workflows?
- Where do controllability gains outweigh capability tradeoffs?
- How should governance differ when model infrastructure is self-hosted versus provider-hosted?

### Connections

- Linked to `local-inference-baseline` as a continuation from local inference practice into deployment-oriented model strategy.
