### Signal

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) frames itself as an open-source coding agent usable in terminal, IDE, and desktop contexts, with provider selection and local connection options.

### Context

The core movement is from closed assistant features toward composable runtime control: model choice, tool choice, and execution environment become explicit configuration points.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this aligns with inspectable mediation. Agency improves when teams can trace where model behavior comes from and swap components without replacing the whole workflow.

### Current State

Fast-moving open project with growing adoption signals.

### Open Questions

- Which parts of agent execution remain difficult to audit in real project use?
- How portable are workflows across providers without hidden regressions?
- What minimal policy layer is needed for safe multi-user operation?

### Connections
