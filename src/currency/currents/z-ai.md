### Signal

[Z.ai](https://z.ai/) presents itself as a free AI chatbot and agent environment built around the GLM model line.

### Context

The interface foregrounds model identity rather than fully hiding it. Users are invited to notice model choice and agent workflow as part of normal interaction.

### Relevance

For Openflows, this indicates a shift from specialized setup toward everyday access. Agent-style interaction is being normalized into standard product surfaces.

### Current State

Active and still stabilizing.

### Open Questions

- How transparent are model boundaries and behavior differences over time?
- Which parts of agent workflow remain inspectable versus abstracted?
- What level of user control is durable as features expand?

### Connections
