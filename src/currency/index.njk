<p>Currency is the living layer of Openflows: what is currently moving through the system as conditions change.</p>

<p>Currency contains three forms with different levels of stability and focus.</p>

<h2>Types of currency</h2>

<h3>Currents</h3>
<p>Provisional movement: tensions, questions, early patterning, and partial insights. Currents preserve sensitivity to change and resist premature certainty.</p>

<h3>Circuits</h3>
<p>Completed loops: moments where convergence and interpretation reconnect to produce a durable shift, where something becomes clarified, integrated, or reusable across contexts.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>
<p>Human agents in the system: people whose practice, decisions, and stewardship make open intelligence legible and actionable.</p>

<p>Some entries include a mediation note documenting when AI assisted the artifact and what role humans played in shaping the outcome.</p>

<p class="meta">Index view: all entries across types, newest first.</p>
