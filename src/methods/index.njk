<p>Openflows is a repeatable sequence for turning distributed input into durable shared understanding.</p>

<h2>Method sequence</h2>

<h3>Pre-flow</h3>
<p>Before people meet, contributions accumulate asynchronously: questions, tensions, observations, and artifacts. The objective is divergence, expanding what might matter without forcing early alignment.</p>

<h3>Mediation</h3>
<p>Patterning happens here. AI may assist with grouping themes or surfacing contradictions, while interpretation remains human. Significant mediation is documented so participants can see where agency sits.</p>

<h3>Convergence</h3>
<p>People meet in physical space for work that requires bodies: sensemaking, emotional truth, productive disagreement, and collective reframing. This is high-intensity work that cannot be reduced to presentation culture.</p>

<h3>Synthesis</h3>
<p>Openflows avoids false closure. Instead of definitive conclusions, synthesis captures what changed, what remains unresolved, what tensions sharpened, and which questions became clearer.</p>

<h3>Redistribution</h3>
<p>Fragments circulate back into communities and networks as short texts, prompts, patterns, or diagrams. The goal is continuity, so future cognition can begin from a stronger baseline.</p>
