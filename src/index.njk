<p>Openflows is cognitive infrastructure.</p>

<p>It links embodied presence, digital systems, and artificial intelligence into a continuous circulation of understanding across rooms and networks, institutions and communities, attention and memory.</p>

<p>Use Openflows when the core problem is integration rather than information: when insight does not travel, meetings do not change outcomes, tools are mistaken for authority, and discourse fragments what community must repair.</p>
